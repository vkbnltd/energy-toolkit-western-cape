Biogas turbines are used to produce electricity during peaks in electricity consumption and during periods of highly unfavorable weather conditions. They can be used flexibly and quickly to balance the power grid when renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power are not producing enough energy.

- **Power** indicates the maximum capacity (nominal capacity), i.e., how fast electricity can be produced at maximum.
- **Turbines** indicates the number of turbines of the specified type required (see [Read more](/assumptions)).
- **Production share** indicates how much of the system's total energy is produced by the gas turbines.

The biogas parameter sets a limit for how much biogas the system can import. See [Read more](/assumptions) for more details.
