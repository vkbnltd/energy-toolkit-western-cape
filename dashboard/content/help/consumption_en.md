The production diagram shows the production and consumption of electricity in the system on a weekly basis and how the different energy sources are utilized to meet the demand. We show the unmet demand as imports in this graph.

The black line represents the demand (load) that the system is expected to meet.

Electricity consumption and production in the system are calculated in 3-hour intervals for an entire year. In this graph, we have calculated the weekly values by summing up the production for each 3-hour interval every week. See [Read more](/assumptions) for more details.
