Hydrogen storage enables long-term storage of surplus energy produced by solar and wind power when conditions are favorable, and then releases that energy during times when production is low, such as at night or on windless days. This creates stability and ensures a continuous electricity supply despite the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources. There is also an industrial demand for hydrogen that is expected to grow significantly due to the green transition.

- **Capacity** indicates how much electricity can be stored.
- **Power** indicates how quickly this electricity can be released back into the system.
- **Share of consumption** indicates the proportion of consumed electricity that comes from the system's hydrogen storage.

Capacity and power have been independently optimized in this model. See [Read more](/assumptions) for more details about hydrogen storage.
