Offshore wind power refers to wind turbines installed at sea. Offshore wind installations benefit from relatively strong and stable winds and are placed far from residential areas. However, they come with high installation and operating costs compared to onshore wind power.

- **Power** indicates the maximum capacity (nominal capacity), i.e., how fast electricity can be produced at maximum.
- **Turbines** indicates the number of wind turbines required (see [Read more](/assumptions)).
- **Production share** indicates how much of the system's total energy is produced by offshore wind power (including electricity for batteries and hydrogen).
