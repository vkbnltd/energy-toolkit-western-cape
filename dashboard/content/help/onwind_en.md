Onshore wind power refers to wind turbines installed on land. Wind power complements solar power and significantly increases the stability of the system. Onshore wind power installations are much cheaper than offshore installations. However, they are somewhat less efficient because wind conditions are less stable, and smaller turbines are used compared to offshore wind turbines.

- **Power** indicates the maximum capacity (nominal capacity), i.e., how fast electricity can be produced at maximum.
- **Turbines** indicates the number of wind turbines required (see [Read more](/assumptions)).
- **Production share** indicates how much of the system's total energy is produced by onshore wind power (including electricity for batteries and hydrogen).
