The system's performance is represented in this bar chart by three metrics:

1. **Fulfilled demand** indicates the share (in percentage and Wh) of the total annual electricity demand in the region that is met by the system.
2. **Unfulfilled demand** indicates the share that is not met and needs to be imported.
3. **Overproduction** indicates the capacity available to produce additional electricity within the system.

Overproduction (also called super power) is electricity that could be produced but is not because there is no demand at that time. In the future, it is likely that we will have a smarter (and therefore more flexible) use of electricity. Examples include industries that partially generate their own electricity and increase production when electricity production is high, or electric vehicles that charge when local electricity production is high.
