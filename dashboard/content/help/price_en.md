This bar chart represents the system's electricity price (excluding taxes and subsidies) and the share that each energy source contributes to this electricity price. This is the so-called LCOE or "Levelized Cost of Electricity." It is calculated by taking the annual capital and operating costs and dividing them by the annual electricity output.

For each energy source, the following is shown:

1. Electricity price (LCOE) for the energy source in ZAR/kWh, i.e., the annual cost of the energy source divided by the annual electricity output.
2. The annual electricity output in Wh.
3. The annual cost of the energy source (annual capital cost and operating cost).

For solar and wind power, the annual electricity output is calculated as the share of electricity production that goes directly to consumption. The production that goes to storage is instead counted as the output from these storage sources.
