#### Notes on limitations

This prototype is limited by the quality of the input data.

- The growth in demand is an illustrative example. It is not based on public data or local analysis.
- The an approximation of a demand has been created by stitching weekly and yearly demand data from the Eskom data portal.
- The areas included/exluded for solar and wind production are tentative and have not been locally validated.
- Costs are based on international estimates which may not be fully applicable to the local context.
- A theoretial future market price of 1 ZAR per kWh has been used to represent purchases from the eletricity market.
