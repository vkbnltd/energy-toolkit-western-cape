### Scenario: {target} growth by {year}

In this scenario the demand for electricity in **{geography}** grows by **{target}** to the year **{year}**. The displayed scenario aims to supply **{sufficiency_target}** of this demand with production within **{geography}**. The actual fulfillment for the year lands at **{sufficiency}** and has capacity for **{super_power}** of super power (electricity at very low marginal cost).

The cost of the produced electricity is greatly affected by the extent to which the installed production capacity is used. In this scenario {solar_cf_phrase}{onwind_cf_phrase}{offwind_cf_phrase}.

The land used for this power generation is {solar_land} for solar and {onwind_land} for onshore wind. This corresponds to {solar_area_percentage_total} and {onwind_area_percentage_total} of the total province area respectivelt. Note that solar and wind production and coexist with other activities on the same parcels of land.
